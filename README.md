# readers_writers_problem

## Compilation

Code requires the use of linux as _/sys/shm.h_ and _/sys/sem.h_. To build the code, run the following:
```
sh build.sh
```
build.sh will generate a build directory with two subdirectories: _./build/readers_pref/_ and _./build/writers_pref/_. These directories contain the readers and writers preference solutions to the readers writers problem respectively.
